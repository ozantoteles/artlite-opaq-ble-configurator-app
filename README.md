This repository contains the Python (3.10) application for configuring c-Air devices in the OPAQ air quality sensor network via Bluetooth. The application runs on Artlite and interacts with EBYTE LoRa modules (E22 and E220) for OPAQ sensor network solutions. It includes functionality to manage device configurations through a JSON file (/usr/local/artlite-opaq-app/config/device_config.json) and update settings as needed, ensuring seamless operation of the sensor network.
